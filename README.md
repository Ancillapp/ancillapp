# Ancillapp

Ancillapp is a PWA (Progressive Web App) that allows to easily consult journals 
(Ancilla Domini), songs, daily prayers and breviary of the Franciscan 
Fraternity of Bethany. The aim of this PWA is to provide an easy access to this 
content to both consecrated and lay people, providing an application-like 
offline-first UX. The entire architecture of the app has been designed to run 
on Google Cloud Platform. In particular, the PWA is ready to be run on App 
Engine out of the box. The data is stored on Firestore, while the files (like 
the journals and their thumbnails) are stored on a Cloud Storage bucket. The 
thumbnails are automatically generated by a Cloud Function when a new journal 
is uploaded into the bucket.
