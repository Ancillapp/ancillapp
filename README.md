# Ancillapp

Ancillapp is a PWA (Progressive Web App) that allows to easily consult journals (Ancilla Domini), songs, daily prayers, and breviary of the Franciscan Fraternity of Bethany. The aim of this PWA is to provide an easy access to this content to both consecrated and lay people, providing an application-like, offline-first UX. The entire architecture of the app has been designed to run on Firebase. The PWA is hosted on Firebase Hosting, the data is stored on Cloud Firestore, and the assets (like the journals and their thumbnails) are stored on a Firebase Storage bucket. The thumbnails are automatically generated by a Firebase Function when a new journal is uploaded into the bucket.
